# BioShiftR (in development\*) ![](reference/figures/BioShiftR_logo.png)

### An R package to access, manipulate, and organize the BioShifts database.

[BioShifts](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/BioShifts_a_global_geodatabase_of_climate-induced_species_redistribution_over_land_and_sea/7413365)
is a global database of over 31,000 changes in species’ range positions
documented in scientific literature, spanning global geographies and
taxonomic groups. The database contains documentations of range changes
as listed in source publications, as well as standardized calculated
rates of change along latitudinal and elevational gradients, and various
supplemental data for hypothesis-testing.

BioShifts is a rich resource for studying the effects of climate change
on the biogeography of life on Earth, but accessing and manipulating the
large and complex database can be daunting.

`BioShiftR` offers a streamlined and simplified approach for accessing,
organizing, and manipulating BioShifts range shift data, with functions
for simple collation of raw data, stardized calculated values,
associated climate velocities, taxonomy, and more.
