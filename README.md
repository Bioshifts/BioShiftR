### An R package to access, manipulate, and organize the BioShifts database.


[BioShifts](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/BioShifts_a_global_geodatabase_of_climate-induced_species_redistribution_over_land_and_sea/7413365) is a global database of over 31,000 changes in species' range positions documented in scientific literature, spanning global geographies and taxonomic groups. The database contains documentations of range changes as listed in source publications, as well as standardized calculated rates of change along latitudinal and elevational gradients, and various supplemental data for hypothesis-testing. 

BioShifts is a rich resource for studying the effects of climate change on the biogeography of life on Earth, but accessing and manipulating the large and complex database can be daunting. 

`BioShiftR` offers a streamlined and simplified approach for accessing, organizing, and manipulating BioShifts range shift data, with functions for simple collation of raw data, stardized calculated values, associated climate velocities, taxonomy, and more.
